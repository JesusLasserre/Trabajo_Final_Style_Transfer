    "Como hemos visto en clase, las primeras capas de una red convolucional se activan ante la presencia de ciertos patrones vinculados a detalles muy pequeños.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medida que avanzamos en las distintas capas de una red neuronal convolucional, los filtros se van activando a medida que detectan patrones de formas cada vez mas complejos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lo que propone este paper es asignarle a la activación de las primeras capas de una red neuronal convolucional (por ejemplo VGG19) la definición del estilo y a la activación de las últimas capas de la red neuronal convolucional, la definición del contenido.\n",
    "\n",
    "La idea de este paper es, a partir de dos imágenes (una que aporte el estilo y otra que aporte el contenido) analizar cómo es la activación de las primeras capas para la imagen que aporta el estilo y cómo es la activación de las últimas capas de la red convolucional para la imagen que aporta el contenido. A partir de esto se intentará sintetizar una imagen que active los filtros de las primeras capas que se activaron con la imagen que aporta el estilo y los filtros de las últimas capas que se activaron con la imagen que aporta el contenido.\n",

    "# Una metodología posible es hacer una lectura rápida del paper (aunque esto signifique no entender algunos detalles del mismo) y luego ir analizando el código y respondiendo las preguntas. A medida que se planteen las preguntas, volviendo a leer secciones específicas del paper terminará de entender los detalles que pudieran haber quedado pendientes.\n",

    "Lo primero que haremos es cargar dos imágenes, una que aporte el estilo y otra que aporte el contenido. A tal fin utilizaremos imágenes disponibles en la web."
